# Prepare directories:
mkdir bin build
# Go in the 'build' directory
cd build
# Prepare the makefile
cmake ..
# Run the new create makefile:
make
# Copy the created binaries in ../bin:
cp ext/gatb-core/bin/dbgh5 ../bin/
cp TakeABreak ../bin/
# Go back at the installation root directory
cd ..
# The directory bin contains 
#  dbgh5 for constructing a de Bruijn graph from any number of read set(s) and
#  TakeABreak that find the Inversion BreakPoints from the graph.
# The TakeABreak.sh pipelines the two tools. Type for instance:
sh ./TakeABreak.sh -r data/toy_example_reads.fasta,data/toy_example_with_inv_reads.fasta
#Try bash instead of sh above if sh does not work

# More details are in doc/user_manual_TakeABreak.txt
