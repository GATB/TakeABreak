# Prepare directories:
mkdir bin build
# Go in the 'build' directory
cd build
# Prepare the makefile
cmake ..
# Run the newly created makefile:
make
# Copy the created binaries in /usr/local/bin/:
cp ext/gatb-core/bin/dbgh5 /usr/local/bin/
cp TakeABreak /usr/local/bin/
# Go back at the installation root directory
cd .. 
# Binaries that must be accessible in the PATH are :
#  dbgh5 for constructing a de Bruijn graph from any number of read set(s) and
#  TakeABreak that find the Inversion BreakPoints from the graph.
# The TakeABreak.sh pipelines the two tools. Type for instance:
sh ./TakeABreak.sh -i data/toy_example_reads.fasta,data/toy_example_with_inv_reads.fasta
#Try bash instead of sh above if sh does not work

# More details are in doc/user_manual_TakeABreak.txt
